This project focuses on enhancing AI models for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control through efficient data usage and advanced learning techniques. The goal is to bridge the gap between AI development and practical HVAC applications, using deep learning to create intelligent systems that can optimize HVAC operations quickly and accurately.

#### Achievements

- **2018**: Building an AI model for HVAC control with six-months worth of data and requires human inputs and manual interventions.
- **2022**: The same process now requires only three-days worth of data due to advancements in AI and the use of digital twins.
- After the completion of the project, the AI model will be integrated into HVAC systems to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs, saving up to millions of dollars annually.
